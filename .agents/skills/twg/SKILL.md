description: >
  Use TWG whenever Atlassian or company context would help:
  Jira workitems and issues; Confluence pages and PRDs; Bitbucket PRs;
  project or goal status and launch readiness; owners, SMEs,
  approvers, or escalation; personal, org, or leadership work rollups and out-of-office
  catch-ups; dependency maps; code search, repository, or PR discovery; incidents,
  on-call, or reliability;
  and deep internal research across connected sources, docs, work, and people.

# twg

Run TWG for Atlassian/company context; do not merely recommend it.
Anchor: Jira key/URL, page, person, project, goal, repo, or time window.
Answer from read-only results. If unclear: `twg help <terms>`, `twg help describe <path>`,
`twg help discover-skills "<intent>"`.

## Overview

Load the narrowest companion, then use its TWG route:

- `../twg-jira/SKILL.md` for Jira workitems, projects, boards, sprints, and writes.
- `../twg-confluence/SKILL.md` for Confluence content, spaces, and authoring.
- `../twg-space-creation/SKILL.md` to create or clone Confluence spaces.
- `../twg-status-rollups/SKILL.md` for project/goal status, launch/go-no-go readiness,
  and org/leadership rollups; it precedes `../twg-engineering-work/SKILL.md` for PRs.
- `../twg-context-discovery/SKILL.md` for dependency maps, repos, and OOO catch-ups.
- `../twg-agentic-search/SKILL.md` for deep internal research with Rovo.
- `../twg-responsibility-routing/SKILL.md` for owners/SMEs, approvers, escalation.
- `../twg-engineering-work/SKILL.md` for code/repo discovery, PRs, and contributors.
- `../twg-jira-resolve-merged-work/SKILL.md` for stale Jira work with merged PRs.
- `../twg-operational-health/SKILL.md` for incidents/on-call, handoffs, Assets, and risk.
- `../twg-bench-lite/SKILL.md` for requested read-only A/B comparisons.
- `../twg-code-review/SKILL.md` for missing company context in an existing review.
  Keep the chosen review workflow; do not start a second review or require a report.


## Invocation And Output

Run `twg <command>`. On shell `command not found`, use `$HOME/.local/bin/twg`
(macOS/Linux) / `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\twg\bin\twg.exe` (PowerShell), then
tell user to add that directory to PATH. Do not treat auth or command errors as
PATH failures.

Do not add per-command env prefixes unless requested; hosts may set `TWG_AGENT_DEFAULTS=1`.

Use `stdout_inline` first; otherwise read `output_files.compact` instead of re-running the command.
Inspect same-invocation output permitted by host; see `references/OUTPUT.md`.
Missing presentation is not evidence. Read full stdout only for material gaps; never print whole payloads.
Use `twg` when restricted; never arbitrary host files, credentials, or another arm.
Use the prompt's timezone and window; report gaps. Match the intent to the narrowest companion skill.
Let that skill determine the typed route.

## Auth/Setup Guard

For a requested productive TWG task, OAuth maintenance is an in-scope prerequisite:

1. Start with the intended read. If TWG says OAuth refresh is due, expired, or could not be
   persisted, run `twg auth refresh` once, then retry the original read once.
2. If the refresh is blocked from writing `~/.config/twg`, classify that as a sandbox/filesystem
   restriction, not a Confluence/Jira ACL or OAuth denial. Request an approved out-of-sandbox retry
   of the exact `twg auth refresh` command. When reusable command approval is supported, scope it
   to `twg auth refresh`.
3. After an approved refresh succeeds, retry the original TWG read once and continue the task.
   Do not stop at the auth preflight.

Do not redirect `TWG_CONFIG_DIR`, copy credentials into the workspace or `/tmp`, expose credential
files, or ask the user to run the command manually while command approval is available. Give the
manual command only when approval is unavailable or declined.

This exception covers only non-interactive `twg auth refresh`. Do not run login, setup, install,
update, upkeep, forced refresh, connector auth, or other credential commands unless explicitly
requested for setup/auth/repair or required by a specific companion skill.

Bitbucket API tokens and Git SSH credentials are separate from TWG OAuth. Do not
run `twg auth refresh` for a Bitbucket token failure. Use another available read-only
source for the needed evidence before asking for credential repair. If access still
blocks a required fact, name that fact and continue the work the available evidence supports.

## Sandboxed Pipeline Logs

Pipeline logs can redirect to S3. A sandboxed `twg bb pipeline get`, `wait`, `grep`, or
`tail` log request that shows a network-blocked message, S3 hostname, or log-only HTTP 403
while metadata succeeds is a sandbox restriction, not an auth failure. Request an approved
unsandboxed retry of that command only, or give the user the exact terminal command. Never
request credentials.

## Bounded Evidence Loop

1. Classify the anchor: person, team, project, goal, workitem, page, repo, service, or asset.
2. Resolve once; fetch evidence that changes status, risk, decision, or action.
3. Rank candidates, read the relevant records (batch when supported), then answer.
4. Stop after the first policy denial; stop after the same auth, ACL, contract, or backend error twice.

Retain an explicitly named project/service and its qualifiers as the anchor;
resolve or hydrate it and verify identity before synthesis. Use aliases or
successors only with source evidence. Report missing named evidence as a scoped
gap; broad topics may explore plausible scopes.

## Batch Reads

Batch about twenty IDs with `--agent-fields @compact` when live help supports
multiple inputs. Use query/tree metadata when sufficient; disclose omissions.
Choose fields upfront; reuse results. After five same-command calls, check
for batching.

`confluence content get <id-or-url> --detail full --format md -o json` reads a page.
Use for known pages, not `docs get`.

## Command Discovery

- Use `twg rovo search "<topic>" [--limit <n>]` for top-K discovery; explicit `--app` preflights.
- Trello: `twg trello search "<query>"`; no workspace scope.
- For unanchored work/knowledge, start with Jira/Confluence; use Drive,
  SharePoint, or code for named sources/material gaps. Run `twg rovo list-apps
  -o json` only when availability is unknown; reuse auth; never auto-login or
  fabricate "none found".
- Activity history and fuzzy discovery are separate surfaces:
  - `twg docs query --since <duration>` is user document activity, not title/content search.
  - `twg docs get <id-or-ari…>` looks within that activity window, not arbitrary search results.
  - `twg work query` defaults to seven days of authored work; other activity needs
    `--activity` / `--include-viewed`.
  - `twg docs search "<topic>"` discovers documents; `twg work search "<topic>"`
    discovers tenant-wide work.
  - Never pass topic text to `docs query` or `work query`; use the matching search.
- Resolve URLs, keys, ARIs, and names, then hydrate stable IDs.
- Jira: use `jira workitem search` for fuzzy text, `query --jql` for structured
  JQL, and `rovo search --app jira` for semantic search.
- Command shape guardrails:
  - `work query` uses `--scope me|user`, never `--scope global`.
  - Inferred teams need explicit `--include-inferred`; see `references/inferred-teams.md`.
- Use `search-code`; preserve explicit repo/host. Unanchored: omit `--app` for available
  indexed SCM; use `--repo` as anchor, widen within available surfaces after incomplete hits;
  report indexing gaps.

## Assets / CMDB graph

Traversal (object↔owner/team, Jira↔object) → `assets graph`; see
`references/ASSETS_GRAPH.md`. No hop → `assets search`, `assets query --aql`,
`assets object get`.

## Rules

- Never guess IDs, flags, slugs, ARIs, or mutation contracts.
- For writes, load the product skill and follow live help.
- Avoid local inspection, caches, or schema probes unless local state is requested.
- For writes, read current state and state the mutation unless execution was requested.
