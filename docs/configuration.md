# Configuration and skills

[Back to README](../README.md)

Install and verify the managed home configuration, share custom skills between Codex and Claude Code, and refresh the TWG skill bundle.

## Tooling commands

Config tooling is implemented in Rust via the `config-tools` binary.

```bash
cargo run -- check
cargo run -- check-codex-skills
cargo run -- check-claude-skills
cargo run -- check-install
cargo run -- prepare
cargo run -- pre-commit
cargo run -- repair-codex-config
cargo run -- validate
cargo run -- test-validate
cargo run -- install
```

Command roles:

- `check`: non-mutating verification for formatting, build, unit tests, skill validation, and regression tests.
- `check-codex-skills`: non-mutating verification that `~/.codex/skills` mirrors custom skills from `.agents/skills`, Codex config has no deprecated/disabled skill-discovery flags, and Codex prompt input sees the managed skills from both this checkout and the home directory.
- `check-claude-skills`: non-mutating verification that `~/.claude/skills` mirrors custom skills from `.agents/skills`, with every managed link resolving to its registry-validated source and no stale managed links left behind.
- `check-install`: non-mutating verification that all managed home config links, Codex skills/config, Claude Code skills, and the managed config-tools binary match this checkout.
- `repair-codex-config`: removes deprecated/disabled Codex feature flags from `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- `prepare`: runs the same verification as `check`.
- `pre-commit`: validates an isolated snapshot of the Git index, so unstaged and untracked work cannot affect the commit checks. Outside Git, runs `prepare` on the supplied checkout. No home installation is required.
- `install`: intentional home-directory mutation for `~/.agents`, custom `~/.codex/skills` and `~/.claude/skills` symlinks, Codex config flag repair, `~/.local/bin/config-tools` and `~/.local/bin/workctl`. Codex itself is installed and updated through its official distribution; this installer does not create a Codex launcher.
- `install-git-hooks`: intentional local Git config mutation for `core.hooksPath`.

## Custom skills

This checkout is the single source of truth for custom skills. One `SKILL.md` per skill is shared by every consumer; install only adds per-consumer symlinks that point back at it:

- Source: `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Agent runtime: `~/.agents -> <checkout>/.agents`
- Codex link: `~/.codex/skills/<name> -> <checkout>/.agents/skills/<name>`
- Claude Code link: `~/.claude/skills/<name> -> <checkout>/.agents/skills/<name>`

Discovery uses the same source layout for both consumers: a top-level, non-hidden `.agents/skills/<name>` directory containing `SKILL.md` is linked; hidden directories and directories without `SKILL.md` are skipped. Linking is idempotent, never clobbers an existing non-managed entry, and removes stale managed links. The `chatgpt-browser-use` skill is linked only into Codex; Claude uses its own browser integration instructions.

### Codex

Codex v0.131 does not expose custom skills as `/skill-name` slash commands. The `/` menu is for built-in TUI commands such as `/skills` and `/subagents`. Invoke these custom skills with the skill mention surface instead, for example:

```text
$surgical-edit
$review-solo
$review-deep
$git-publish-to-origin
$one-clear-sentence
```

Do not add `register_cmd` to skill front matter. Current Codex ignores that legacy key, so this repo rejects it to avoid implying that custom skills appear as slash commands.

### Claude Code

Claude Code discovers personal skills from `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, which is the same `SKILL.md` format the registry already validates (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`). Install links custom skills other than `chatgpt-browser-use` into `~/.claude/skills`, creating the directory if it does not exist. Discoverability is proven deterministically: `check-claude-skills` asserts each `~/.claude/skills/<name>` resolves to its registry-validated source, which is exactly the contract Claude Code's loader requires.

## TWG CLI skills

The tracked `twg*` skills are the workflow layer for the TWG CLI. They teach agents to use live CLI help instead of guessing command grammar, route Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, and cross-product requests to focused workflows, prefer machine-readable output, and distinguish PATH, authentication, authorization, and command errors.

TWG remains the source of the bundle. Because `~/.agents` links into this checkout, an upstream skill refresh overwrites files here and can remove skills omitted by a newer release. Save existing changes before updating, review the resulting diff, and preserve local OAuth recovery, review-context behavior, and the benchmark helper before publishing. Keep unrelated config changes out of the refresh commit. The updater can also replace managed agent links with TWG-owned copies. Back up those copies before restoring links to this checkout, and preserve unrelated skill directories. Then reconcile the managed Codex and Claude Code links:

```bash
twg update --refresh-skills
cargo run -- validate
cargo run -- install
```

Use these read-only checks when diagnosing access or discovery:

```bash
twg doctor -o json
twg help discover-skills "<intent>" -o json
twg help describe "<command-or-skill>" -o json
cargo run -- check-codex-skills
cargo run -- check-claude-skills
```

Do not copy TWG's full command catalog into `AGENTS.md`: command details change with the CLI, while the installed skills use progressive disclosure and query live help. If a new Codex session does not show the skills, run `cargo run -- install`, verify with `check-codex-skills`, and restart Codex so it rebuilds its skill inventory.

## Verify installation

To diagnose the current user's installation, run these explicit checks separately. Installation drift does not block repository commits:

```bash
cargo run -- check-codex-skills
cargo run -- check-claude-skills
cargo run -- check-install
```

For manual verification of install behavior, use a temporary home without touching the real home directory:

```bash
cargo run -- prepare

tmp_home="$(mktemp -d)"
for skill in skill-creator skill-installer; do
  mkdir -p "$tmp_home/.codex/skills/.system/$skill"
  printf 'fixture\n' > "$tmp_home/.codex/skills/.system/$skill/SKILL.md"
done
cargo run -- install --home "$tmp_home"
find "$tmp_home" -maxdepth 4 -type l -exec ls -la {} \;
rm -rf "$tmp_home"
```

Expected symlink behavior:

- `~/.agents` links to this config checkout's `.agents` directory.
- `~/.zsh` links to this config checkout's `zsh` directory.
- `~/.zshrc` links to this config checkout's `zsh/zshrc` file.
- `~/.config/ghostty/config` links to this config checkout's `ghostty/config` file.
- `~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config` is absent so Ghostty loads the managed config only once.
- `~/.config/relay/config.toml` links to this config checkout's `relay/config.toml` file.
- `~/.local/bin/config-tools` and `~/.local/bin/workctl` are runnable copies of the Rust multicall executable.
- Codex runs directly from the official Homebrew installation. The shell prefers `/opt/homebrew/bin` over older `/usr/local/bin` tools; no config-repair wrapper is installed.
- `~/.codex/skills/.system` remains a Codex-owned directory with Codex system skills.
- Each custom top-level `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directory links into `~/.codex/skills/<name>` and, except for `chatgpt-browser-use`, `~/.claude/skills/<name>`.
- `~/.claude/skills` is created if missing; the directory itself is not symlinked, only the per-skill entries inside it.
- Hidden skill directories and directories without `SKILL.md` are not linked into Codex or Claude Code.
- Existing non-empty files/directories or unrelated symlinks are not replaced automatically.
